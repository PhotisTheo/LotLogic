        <p class="mb-4">

          web application, APIs, data products, mobile interfaces, and any services provided by
          Lead CRM, LotLogic, or their affiliates ("Lead CRM," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating
          an account, accessing the Services, or participating in the Lead CRM beta program, you
          ("Customer," "User," or "you") agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are
          accepting these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and
          warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 fw-bold">
          IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mt-5">1. Definitions</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>"Services"</strong> means the Lead CRM platform, dashboard, APIs, data exports, skip tracing
          modules, analytics, mailer tools, mobile interfaces, and any professional services or
          support we provide.

        <p class="mb-2"><strong>"Unauthorized Use"</strong> means any access to or use of the Services in violation of these
          Terms or outside the scope of the rights expressly granted to Customer. Unauthorized Use
          includes, without limitation:</p>
        <ol class="mb-3">
          <li><strong>Access by Any Person Other Than the Registered Individual.</strong> Each account is
            for a single natural person. Access or use by any other person—whether an
            employee, contractor, virtual assistant, business partner, or third party—is strictly
            prohibited.</li>
          <li><strong>Account Sharing or Credential Sharing.</strong> Sharing passwords, API keys,
            authentication tokens, or login sessions is strictly prohibited, regardless of
            whether done intentionally or for convenience.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Individuals Operating Under One Account.</strong> Simultaneous logins or
            alternating use of the same account by more than one person constitutes
            Unauthorized Use.</li>
          <li><strong>Circumventing Verification or Limits.</strong> Creating additional accounts, false
            identities, or alternate emails to bypass identity verification, usage limits, billing
            rules, or compliance controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Use by Automated Tools Not Approved in Writing.</strong> Any bots, scripts, or
            automation that logs in as the registered user without written authorization.</li>
          <li><strong>Use After Termination or Suspension.</strong> Accessing or attempting to access the
            Services after the account has been suspended, disabled, or terminated.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong>"Confidential Information"</strong> means non-public information disclosed by one party to the
          other, whether oral, written, or electronic, that is designated as confidential or should
          reasonably be understood to be confidential based on its nature.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong>"Customer Data"</strong> means any data, files, content, messages, or materials submitted to the

        <p class="mb-4">
          You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and all activity that occurs under
          your account. You must notify us of any unauthorized use. We may suspend accounts that
          are unverified, compromised, or that share passwords across multiple users. Account
          sharing is prohibited. Any attempt to share account credentials, or attempted use of
          credentials by anyone other than the registered individual may result in account
          revocation.
