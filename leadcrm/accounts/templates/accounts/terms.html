          These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Lead CRM web application,
          related data products, and any software, mobile experiences, or professional services provided by Lead CRM,
          LotLogic, or their affiliates (“Lead CRM,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By creating an account, accessing the platform,
          or participating in the Lead CRM beta program, you (“you,” “Customer,” or “User”) agree to these Terms and our
          Privacy Policy. If you are accepting on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have
          the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mt-5">1. Definitions</h2>

        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Services. When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate,
          current, and complete information, including a verifiable business email address. You must not impersonate another person or entity or misrepresent your
          association with one. Lead CRM reserves the right to reject or suspend any account if we detect duplicate registrations, fraudulent intent, or misuse.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">3. Account Security & Email Verification</h2>

          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
          Email verification is mandatory for all new accounts. We may disable or delete accounts that are not verified within a reasonable period. Creating multiple accounts with the same email,

          If you access Beta Services, you acknowledge that they may be incomplete, contain defects, or change without notice. Beta Services are provided “as is” for evaluation purposes only.
          We may collect usage metrics, feedback, and crash data to improve the platform. You agree to keep Beta features confidential unless we make them public and acknowledge that
          Beta access may be revoked at any time. No service-level guarantees or uptime commitments apply to Beta Services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">5. License & Permitted Use</h2>
